## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### 1. Credential Management

**API Keys and Tokens**

```bash
# Use environment variables, never hardcode credentials
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
export WORDPRESS_PASSWORD="your-app-password-here"

# Use Docker secrets for production
echo "your-api-key" | docker secret create gemini_api_key -
```

**n8n Credentials**

- Use strong, unique passwords for n8n basic auth
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Regularly rotate API keys and passwords
- Use OAuth2 instead of basic authentication when possible

#### 2. Network Security

**Firewall Configuration**

```bash
# Only allow necessary ports
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp    # SSH
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp    # HTTP (for Let's Encrypt)
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp   # HTTPS
sudo ufw deny 5678/tcp   # Block direct n8n access
sudo ufw enable
```

**SSL/TLS Configuration**

```nginx
# Use strong SSL configuration
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;
ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
ssl_session_timeout 10m;

# Security headers
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000" always;
add_header X-Frame-Options DENY always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;
```

#### 3. Docker Security

**Container Security**

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml security settings
version: "3.8"
services:
  n8n:
    image: docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
    user: "1000:1000" # Run as non-root user
    read_only: true # Read-only filesystem
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - CHOWN
      - SETGID
      - SETUID
```

**Volume Permissions**

```bash
# Set proper permissions for volumes
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /opt/n8n/data
sudo chmod -R 750 /opt/n8n/data
```

#### 4. Database Security

**PostgreSQL Configuration**

```sql
-- Create dedicated user with minimal privileges
CREATE USER n8n_user WITH PASSWORD 'strong_random_password';
CREATE DATABASE n8n_db OWNER n8n_user;
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE n8n_db TO n8n_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO n8n_user;
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO n8n_user;
```

**Connection Security**

```yaml
# Use SSL for database connections
environment:
  - DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_ENABLED=true
  - DB_POSTGRESDB_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=true
```

### For Developers

#### 1. Code Security

**Input Validation**

- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before processing
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper error handling

**Secret Management**

```javascript
// Never log sensitive data
console.log("Processing request for user:", userId); // ✅ Good
console.log("API Key:", apiKey); // ❌ Bad

// Use secure random generation
const crypto = require("crypto");
const token = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString("hex");
```

#### 2. API Security

**Rate Limiting**

```javascript
// Implement rate limiting for API calls
const rateLimit = {
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
};
```

**Authentication**

```javascript
// Always verify API responses
if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error(`API Error: ${response.status}`);
}

// Validate response data
const data = await response.json();
if (!isValidResponse(data)) {
  throw new Error("Invalid API response");
}
```
